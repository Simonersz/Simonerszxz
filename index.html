                <h2>My Passion</h2>
                <p>Dancing, for me is when you are watching a person dance. You are not only watching more than just a person dancing, you are actually watching hundreds of hours of failures and experimentation. You are watching days, weeks and months of frustration and moments of pure joy. You aren't just watching a person. You are watching a piece of heart, part of a soul, a moment of someone's life.
                    Dancing is one of those few activities that you need to exert extra effort and time. Dancing is a passion it is that something you work hard for, something that you never want to give up on. The most exciting part of Dancing are the Competitions, where you perform your dance routine in front of hundreds of people and before you’re able to perform you need to make sure your Hair, Costume, Makeup or Shoes before you go out on the Dance floor. 
                    There are so many benefits of dancing like winning in the big competitions but as a dancer winning in the dance competition is just a bonus for us because we aim a clean dance routine in every competition that we’re joining. My first Competition was in the year 2017 it is an inter-school competition that was held in Pasig City. I was so happy because I represent my school in that competition and we were Ranked 8 over 34 crews who competed in the event.
                    Dance is more than just a sport, it is a passion. You have to work hard and push yourself in order to be the best. I am so blessed that dancing becomes my passion. Because of this I become more confident and a better person. So, I believe that lessons in dance can lead to lessons in life.
